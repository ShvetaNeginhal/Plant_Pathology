# Plant_Pathology
A repo  for classifying diseases in plants using CNN. An attempt to understand the hyper-parameters and improve the model.

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2020-fgvc7/data
Framework : Keras 
Metrics: Fbeta

 
Notebook1 is created by fine tuning the model. Also Data Augmentation when used, has proved in improving the model by increasing the Fbeta value to a very larger extent (around 20%).
